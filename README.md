#[A Code of Ethics for Software Engineers?](https://www.cio.com/article/3156565/developer/should-software-developers-have-a-code-of-ethics.html)

With technology and software playing such an important, involved role in each of our lives, many have started to question whether there should be a code of ethics that guides those who develop said software. While many, including myself, would argue that technology is a tool that can be used to serve both good and bad intentions, it is also naive to think that it is software is an unbaised tool, uninfluenced by the guidelines and thought processes of the developers who make it. While I'm not sure if software engineers should be held to a standardized oath or code of ethics, I think is it important for us to at least think about and discuss the ethical implications of the technologies we are developing, making the ethical choices we make more conscious.
